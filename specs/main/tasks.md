## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Manual Downloads (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Student can manually download lessons for offline use within a 500MB limit.

**Independent Test**: Click download on a lesson, turn off internet, and still be able to open that lesson.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T018 [US3] Implement useContentDownload hook using Cache API in src/hooks/useContentDownload.ts
- [X] T019 [US3] Implement Download Manager organism in src/components/organisms/DownloadManager/DownloadManager.tsx
- [X] T020 [US3] Integrate LRU cleanup into download flow to maintain 500MB limit in src/services/storage/cache.service.ts
- [X] T021 [P] [US3] Add Download Status badges to Lesson Cards in src/components/organisms/LessonCard/LessonCard.tsx

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Progress & Sync (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Student progress is tracked locally and synchronized via cumulative merge.

**Independent Test**: Complete a lesson offline, reconnect, and see completion reflected on the server/dashboard.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T022 [US4] Implement useProgressStore for local tracking in src/store/useProgressStore.ts
- [X] T023 [US4] Implement background sync trigger in src/hooks/useOfflineSync.ts
- [X] T024 [P] [US4] Create Progress Dashboard organism in src/components/organisms/ProgressDashboard/ProgressDashboard.tsx
- [ ] T025 [US4] Integrate sync status indicator in src/components/organisms/SyncStatus/SyncStatus.tsx

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T026 [P] Final Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) audit on all interactive components
- [ ] T027 [P] Update quickstart.md with deployment and sync testing instructions
- [ ] T028 Performance profiling for initial load on slow networks
- [ ] T029 Code cleanup and final type check

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 & 2**: Mandatory prerequisites for all features.
- **Phase 3 (Auth)**: Essential for personalized progress and sync.
- **Phase 4 (Viewing)**: Depends on Phase 1 (i18n).
- **Phase 5 (Downloads)**: Depends on Phase 1 (PWA) and Phase 2 (LRU).
- **Phase 6 (Sync)**: Depends on Phase 2 (Sync Manager) and Phase 3 (Auth).

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003, T004 (i18n and Styling)
- T008, T009 (LRU and Types)
- T012 (PIN Input) can be done while T010/T011 are in progress
- T016 (Language Switcher) can be done while T015 is in progress
- T021 (Badges) can be done while T019 is in progress
- T024 (Dashboard) can be done while T022/T023 are in progress
